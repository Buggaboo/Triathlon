TODO 25-11-09
- must document how to get project up and running in slackware64
  => * build all dependencies...
  => * create group, give sudoer rights... for access to raw input
- must maintain all project dependencies and slackbuilds not in sbo.org
  => sbo.org: wxwidgets (must have: common and addons), wxpython, pyopengl, python-xlib, numpy, pyusb
  => not in sbo.org: python-mdp (ai), SWIG, fann, pyfann
- write slackbuilds for each missing slackbuild component
- apply for adding components to sbo.org
- build valgrind and kcachegrind and installpkg
- get ccache to work
- get icec or distcc
- get both to work
+ run python debugger pydb on the project
  => I wasn't patient enough trace the last call prior to the segfault
+ run pdb again, with noGL = False, trace the last call before segfault
  => opengl causes the crash in the vm guest no doubt about it
+ but running 'sudo gdb python' gave me a good error though:
  => Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
  => [Switching to Thread 0xb7d236c0 (LWP 4487)]
  => 0xb552ab46 in glLightfv () from /usr/lib/libGL.so.1

TODO 22-11-09
- figure out if my pull from the svn is the latest
- write script to synchronize my git with their svn
- debug whole application with pdb (python debug), to figure out where it segfaults
+ test 'glxgears' and 'glxinfo | grep direct | grep -o Yes' under vm
  => it works
- set udev rules to allow usb direct read access, so 'sudo' will not be necessary to run triathlon
+ must run image as 'sh start-tap.sh images/vdisk-linux-ubuntuserver.img tap0 e1000 "-usb -usbdevice host:1234:0000"'
  => to run with pass host usb to vm guest, add_usb in vm command line does not register device

TODO 15-11-09
+ install dependencies on ubuntu vm
+ pass "-usb -usbdevice `dmesg | grep "Brain" | egrep -o ":[0-9]{4}:[0-9]{4}." | sed 's/^:\|\.$//g'" to qemu-system-x86_64
+ run Triathlon => failed to run.
- tell Triathlon developers that a git repository has been created
