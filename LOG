* The last slackbuild has been created. Testing software on x86_64 machine.
* Last challenge: allow normal user to access usb device using udev rule in ./etc/udev/rules.d/
* Tested software, broken in some parts due to old libfann invocation code
* Other broken parts due to bad openGL and python interfacing

* Fugging pyfann.SlackBuild generates an error right after the fann.SlackBuild's resulting .tgz is installed. The error is in the debug/.
* Luckily I found the cause of the error, the missing file 'doublefann.o' is under /tmap/SBo/fann-2.0.0/src/.libs/doublefann.o, some dickhead forgot the all the compiled object files will land inside .libs, a hidden path too.

* PyOpenGL depends on pysetuptools
* The wx build is over 1 gigabyte.
* There's a good chance that the wxpython slackbuild here will subsume the normal wxwidget build; the readme states this possibility to be likely.
* Today I started gathering all the dependencies for this project to work on a slackware 13.0 machine.
* I increased my /tmp to 1gb for building wxwidgets, what a big -ing project. Building on memory is infinitely faster than distcc or ccache can throw at it. But use ccache anyhow! tmpfs            /tmp             tmpfs       size=1024M         0 0
* Before installing on the main system I should check the packages on a virtual machine see if anything gets fuxxxored.

* Use 'python -m pdb script.py -c "noGL = True"', to run the python debugger
* Hmmmm... -c doesn't work, but changing the parameter in the script does. You get the wx analyzer screen without opengl of course.
* I could have known that the cause of the crash would be opengl...

* Tried to get it to run in a ubuntu vm, but failed miserably due to a segfault.
* Will attempt to run valgrind on the fucker. 'sudo python Triathlon-Auditor.py' will segfault it.
* I installed fann from source, I also installed the python bindings, that went well.

LOG 15-11-09
* Starting development from ubuntu vm to test if ocz nia can replace mouse
* Initial milestone: get Triathlon to work
