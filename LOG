* Today I started gathering all the dependencies for this project to work on a slackware 13.0 machine.
* I increased my /tmp to 1gb for building wxwidgets, what a big -ing project. Building on memory is infinitely faster than distcc or ccache can throw at it. But use ccache anyhow! tmpfs            /tmp             tmpfs       size=1024M         0 0
* Before installing on the main system I should check the packages on a virtual machine see if anything gets fuxxxored.

* Use 'python -m pdb script.py -c "noGL = True"', to run the python debugger
* Hmmmm... -c doesn't work, but changing the parameter in the script does. You get the wx analyzer screen without opengl of course.
* I could have known that the cause of the crash would be opengl...

* Tried to get it to run in a ubuntu vm, but failed miserably due to a segfault.
* Will attempt to run valgrind on the fucker. 'sudo python Triathlon-Auditor.py' will segfault it.
* I installed fann from source, I also installed the python bindings, that went well.

LOG 15-11-09
