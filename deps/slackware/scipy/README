SciPy (pronounced "Sigh Pie") is open-source software for mathematics, 
science, and engineering.
The SciPy library is built to work with NumPy arrays, and provides many 
user-friendly and efficient numerical routines such as routines for numerical 
integration and optimization. Together, they run on all popular operating 
systems, are quick to install, and are free of charge. NumPy and SciPy are 
easy to use, but powerful enough to be depended upon by some of the world's 
leading scientists and engineers.

This package requires NumPy, Matplotlib, iPython, BLAS, LAPACK, and FFTW.
