# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

scipy: SciPy (python library for math, science, and engineering)
scipy: 
scipy: The SciPy library is built to work with NumPy arrays, and provides many 
scipy: user-friendly and efficient numerical routines such as routines for numerical 
scipy: integration and optimization. Together, they run on all popular operating 
scipy: systems, are quick to install, and are free of charge. NumPy and SciPy are 
scipy: easy to use, but powerful enough to be depended upon by some of the world's 
scipy: leading scientists and engineers.
